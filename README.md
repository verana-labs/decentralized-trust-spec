# decentralized-trust-spec

Draft specification for Decentralized Trust (DT) services and user agents. It proposes a system using verifiable credentials and Decentralized Trust Registries (DTRs) to establish secure, zero-trust communication channels. The specification details requirements for DT services and user agents, including essential credential schemas for various entities (services, organizations, persons, user agents). It outlines procedures for credential issuance, presentation requests, and trust resolution, aiming to create a more trustworthy and interoperable internet. The specification also addresses aspects like DID Documents and whitelists of trusted DTRs.
